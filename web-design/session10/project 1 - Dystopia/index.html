                <h2>Cyberpunk</h2>
                <p>Cyberpunk is a dystopian vision of the future where advanced technology, often centered around cybernetics and artificial intelligence, coexists with societal decay and corporate domination. Set in gritty urban landscapes, cyberpunk worlds are characterized by neon-lit streets, towering skyscrapers, and a stark divide between the wealthy elite and the impoverished masses. Technology is both a tool of empowerment and oppression, with characters often hacking into systems or augmenting their bodies with cybernetics to survive. The themes of cyberpunk revolve around the loss of individuality, the blurring line between human and machine, and the consequences of unchecked technological advancement.</p>

                <h2>Atompunk</h2>
                <p>Atompunk is a retro-futuristic genre rooted in the mid-20th century, reflecting the optimism and anxieties of the Atomic Age. It draws inspiration from the post-World War II era, particularly the 1950s and 1960s, when the world was fascinated by nuclear power, space exploration, and the potential of modern science. Atompunk worlds are characterized by sleek, futuristic designs, ray guns, space rockets, and the iconic imagery of atomic energy. The genre explores the tension between the promise of scientific progress and the fear of nuclear annihilation, often incorporating elements of Cold War paranoia and mid-century modern aesthetics. Atompunk is a nostalgic reflection on a time when the future seemed both hright.</p>
